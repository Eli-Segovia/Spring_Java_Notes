# Spring Boot

Remember - Spring Boot is a extension of Spring -- it is one of Spring's projects. Essentially Spring Boot allows you to build web apps & REST APIs.

However, you can do that without Spring Boot -> you can do it yourself. So why do we even need to bother with learning Spring Boot?

## The World before Spring Boot

It was hard. Needed a lot of Configuration :( -- we would need to specify all of our dependencies ourselves in the POM.xml. There were a bunch of other configs, as well as worrying about non-functional features (logging error handling and Monitoring). All of this would need to be done for every new project.

Apparently, it takes a few days to setup each project. (Idk if I buy this. Why would you rely so heavily on a framework to be successful?)
