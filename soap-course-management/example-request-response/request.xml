<!--  Notice Here we have to provide the xmlns and point to namespace that is in url format. Normally you would actually put that in
      the website of the same url, but it's not strictly necessary. website url format just seems to be the standard for defining namespaces
      even Java (packages).

      Xsi tells us where we can find this schema. Again, we point to the URL (normally it would be there). AS well as the physical local copy relative
      to the current file :).

      IntelliJ Idea is smart and actually validates this example with the schema and any errors will be highlighted in red.
