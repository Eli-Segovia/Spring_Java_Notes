# Maven :)

You already have some hands on experience with maven. This is to capture any stuff that you just haven't gathered...

I have some notes in the pom.xml itself as well :)

### Reminder of Maven Lifecycle:
* Validate
* Compile
* Test
* Package
* Integration Test
* Verify
* Install
* Deploy


### How does Maven Work?
* Convention Over Configuration
  * You just do what is expected, i.e.: same folder structure, same property file structure, etc.
* Use Maven central and other artifact repositories
