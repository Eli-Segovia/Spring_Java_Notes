# About the src/resources directory

The src/resources directory is where XML config files and .properties files live

The .properties file defines properties that we can use in our code. There are some default .properties properties that we can define out of the box, but we may also define our own properties by making the appropriate class and use the right annotations for Spring to recognize our custom properties.
